# Generalized Archive Module

Given the GPL-3.0 license, this standalone module can be freely used in compliance with the NeuralNexus API's licensing terms, as long as the user implements their own authenicaiton and authorization system that does not rely on the NeuralNexus API's authentication system. (In short, one cannot commercially use the NeuralNexus API's authentication system in a competing product, whereas self-hosting the NeuralNexus API is permitted.)
